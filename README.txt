If you do not have glm installed, do:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install libglm-dev
    ```

To run the code, do:
    ```
    make
    ./texture [texture.bmp] < [example.obj]
    ```
    It should take no longer than 3 seconds for GL window to pop up.

    example:
    ```
    ./texture data/strawberry.bmp < data/bunny.obj
    ```
    
    I have downloaded other .bmp files too for you to try.
